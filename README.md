6. create a filter for the news I'm displaying so that I don't get blank spaces or margin errors (due to long url displayed in the text of the news) 
7. Research time. Topic: Animation in React: react-spring
8. Coding time

    **GOAL: animate the site when it renders**

9. Add a loading icon during the time it takes to fetch all the news

> ## New skills (to research):

- react-spring for animation

> ## Achievements + lessons learned:

- Using a library for the animation effects (react-spring)
https://www.react-spring.io/

- How to filter news better in the app by mapping and filtering arrays

- get used to component local states 

> ## Ideas for the future:

- Add an option to change the language of the site

- Fetch news in different languages
